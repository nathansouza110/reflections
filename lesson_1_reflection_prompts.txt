How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It separated the lines that truly were modified in the code from the rest, so that I could only see what is really different. That way I could find the typo faster than looking at all the code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Reviewing modifications in code will help better document the change process and reverse in case of a big modification.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I can save different file in the time space that I want, and knowing the modification. Best for testing new code without losing the old one.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
